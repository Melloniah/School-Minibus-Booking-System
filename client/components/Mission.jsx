          We're on a mission to solve transportation challenges in Kenya where
          children face unsafe commutes to school due to unreliable public
          transport and expensive private options. Through our innovative
          web-based platform, we connect families with professional drivers and
          safe minibuses, making quality education accessible by ensuring
          children can get to school safely, affordably, and happily every
          single day!
